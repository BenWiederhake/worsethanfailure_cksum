Reverse-engineering the implicit behavior of text/binary tag/untagged flags in GNU cksum.

Yes, the source is available, but reading it means that any conclusion from
reading it also falls under the GNU GPL. But because I want to use the
conclusions in [an MIT-licensed project](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils),
I can't read the source without causing legal headaches.

End result: https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/6364

There's nothing more than that.
